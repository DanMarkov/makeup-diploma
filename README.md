### Attention! Project has notable bugs that I haven't fixed them yet

Specifically: 

* For the second section images doesn't have transparent background when they should
* For the forth section Swiper slider is not configured properly 

Also to make a note there are two different sliders - Swiper.js and Slick. The last one I'm familiar more thus configuring it seemed comfortable enough to me.
